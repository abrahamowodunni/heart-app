HeartGuard: Predictive Healthcare Application
In the realm of predictive healthcare, HeartGuard stands as an industry-level project aimed at revolutionizing the early detection of heart disease. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, HeartGuard is a predictive analytics application developed to empower healthcare professionals in preemptively addressing heart-related ailments.

Project Overview:
HeartGuard embarks on a data-driven journey comprising Exploration, Discovery, and Application (EDA). The dataset, distilled from the 2022 CDC survey, encapsulates 40 key variables, ranging from blood pressure to lifestyle choices. The project goes beyond traditional Exploratory Data Analysis, delving into Feature Engineering and employing an ensemble of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Decision Trees.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Model Comparison:

Explored and compared various machine learning models to identify the most adept predictor of heart disease risks.
Ensemble of models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, ANN, and Decision Trees, were rigorously evaluated.
Web Application Development with Flask:

Utilized the Flask framework to develop a user-friendly web application, HeartGuard.
Designed for healthcare professionals, the application provides rapid, data-driven insights into potential heart disease risks.
MLOps Skills and Deployment:

Demonstrated MLOps skills by deploying the application for production use.
Integrated deep learning and machine learning algorithms into a practical tool for early detection.
